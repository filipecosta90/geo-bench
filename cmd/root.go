	Long: `Geopoints are a data type used to represent geographic coordinates in various databases, including Redis, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB.
This repository contains a set of scripts and tools for running benchmarks on geopoint data in these databases. 
The benchmarks in this repository cover a range of common operations, such as indexing, searching, and querying data based on geographic coordinates. 
The results of the benchmarks can be used to compare the performance of Redis, ElasticSearch, and MongoDB when working with geopoint data, and to identify potential bottlenecks or areas for optimization. 

By providing benchmarks for these popular databases, this repository can be a useful resource for developers and data professionals working with geopoint data.`,
